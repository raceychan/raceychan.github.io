# Blog Author Section Enhancement Plan

## Plan Section

### Objective
Update the blog page to add a prominent "Follow me on X" feature in the author section and make the subscription feature much more noticeable.

### Technical Analysis

#### Current State Assessment
- **Author Section**: Located in `src/theme/BlogPostItem/Header/Authors/index.tsx`
- **Current Features**: Author name, title, profile image, GitHub/X links in `blog/authors.yml`
- **Subscribe Widget**: `src/components/SubscriptionWidget/index.tsx` with 90% scroll trigger
- **Social Integration**: `src/components/social_share.tsx` for post sharing
- **Author Data**: `blog/authors.yml` contains X handle (`x: lihil_cc`) and GitHub profile

#### Identified Improvements Needed

1. **Author Section Enhancement**
   - Current X/Twitter link is minimal (just URL in metadata)
   - Need prominent "Follow me on X" call-to-action button
   - Should be visually distinct from other author information

2. **Subscribe Feature Visibility Issues**
   - Currently only appears after 90% scroll (too late in user journey)
   - Desktop placement in right sidebar might be overlooked
   - Mobile placement at bottom may not be seen

### Proposed Solution

#### 1. Enhanced Author Section with "Follow me on X" Feature

**Implementation Approach:**
- Extend `src/theme/BlogPostItem/Header/Authors/index.tsx`
- Add dedicated social action buttons below author bio
- Create prominent "Follow me on X" button with X branding
- Maintain responsive design principles

**Design Specifications:**
- Button styling: X brand colors (black/white theme-aware)
- Icon: X logo with "Follow @lihil_cc" text
- Placement: Directly below author information, before post content
- Hover effects and accessibility considerations
- External link behavior (opens in new tab)

**Data Requirements:**
- Utilize existing X handle from `blog/authors.yml` (`x: lihil_cc`)
- Generate X profile URL: `https://x.com/lihil_cc`
- Graceful handling if X URL not provided
- Support for multiple authors with social links

#### 2. Enhanced Subscribe Feature Visibility

**Strategy 1: Earlier Trigger & Multiple Placements**
- Reduce scroll trigger from 90% to 30% for earlier visibility
- Add additional placement in author section as secondary CTA
- Maintain existing sticky right sidebar placement

**Strategy 2: Visual Enhancement**
- Increase widget size and prominence
- Add animated elements or subtle pulsing effect
- Improve color contrast and call-to-action text
- Add success/error state animations

**Strategy 3: Smart Positioning**
- Author section mini-subscribe CTA (subtle)
- Enhanced right sidebar widget (primary)
- Optional: Floating widget for mobile (non-intrusive)

## Experience Section

### Key Insights Learned:
1. **Docusaurus Theme Overrides**: Successfully swizzled BlogAuthor component to add custom social functionality while maintaining existing feature compatibility.

2. **Sticky vs Static Positioning**: Initial attempt used sticky positioning which caused TOC overlap. Solution was static positioning in document flow order for clean separation.

3. **State Management**: localStorage integration allows subscription/close state to persist across sessions, preventing user annoyance from repeated prompts.

4. **Component Reusability**: Single SubscriptionWidget component handles both fixed (desktop) and mobile variants through props, maintaining DRY principles.

5. **User Experience Focus**: Added loading states, success feedback, and graceful error handling to create professional subscription flow.

### Technical Challenges Solved:
- **Theme Integration**: Learned how to properly override Docusaurus theme components while maintaining existing functionality
- **CSS Positioning**: Resolved overlapping issues between sticky subscription widget and TOC through proper positioning strategy
- **Form Handling**: Implemented proper async form submission with loading states for external Buttondown service
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Used CSS custom properties and modern flexbox for consistent styling across browsers

### Future Considerations:
- Could add A/B testing for subscription widget copy/design
- Potential integration with email marketing analytics
- Consider adding social proof (subscriber count) if Buttondown API supports it
